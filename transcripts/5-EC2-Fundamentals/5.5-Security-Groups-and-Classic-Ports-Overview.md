# 5.5 - Security Groups & Classic Ports Overview

## Key Concepts

### 1. Security Groups = Firewall for EC2
- Control inbound (in) and outbound (out) traffic
- Only contain **allow** rules (no deny rules)
- Rules reference IP addresses or other security groups
- Live **outside** the EC2 instance (instance never sees blocked traffic)

### 2. Security Group Rules
- **Type:** SSH, HTTP, etc.
- **Protocol:** TCP, UDP
- **Port:** which port to allow
- **Source:** IP range (0.0.0.0/0 = everywhere) or another security group

### 3. Key Behaviors
- Can be attached to **multiple instances** (and vice versa)
- Locked to a **region/VPC** combination
- **Default:** all inbound blocked, all outbound allowed
- **Timeout** = security group issue (traffic never reached instance)
- **Connection refused** = security group OK, application issue

### 4. Referencing Other Security Groups
- Instead of allowing by IP, you can allow by security group
- If Instance B has SG-2 attached, and Instance A allows SG-2 inbound → B can connect to A
- No need to manage IPs — common pattern with load balancers

### 5. Classic Ports to Know

| Port | Protocol | Used For                              |
|------|----------|---------------------------------------|
| 22   | SSH      | Log into Linux instances              |
| 21   | FTP      | Upload files to a file share          |
| 22   | SFTP     | Secure file transfer (over SSH)       |
| 80   | HTTP     | Unsecured websites                    |
| 443  | HTTPS    | Secured websites (standard nowadays)  |
| 3389 | RDP      | Log into Windows instances            |

## Exam Tips
- Timeout = security group blocking traffic
- Connection refused = app problem, not security group
- SSH (port 22) = Linux, RDP (port 3389) = Windows
- Security groups can reference other security groups (no IP needed)
- All inbound blocked by default, all outbound allowed by default
