# 5.2 - EC2 Basics

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is EC2?
- Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Rent virtual machines (instances) on demand
- EC2 ecosystem includes: instances, EBS volumes, ELB, Auto Scaling Groups

### 2. EC2 Instance Configuration Options
- **OS:** Linux (most popular), Windows, macOS
- **CPU:** compute power and number of cores
- **RAM:** amount of memory
- **Storage:** network-attached (EBS/EFS) or hardware-attached (Instance Store)
- **Network:** network card speed, public IP
- **Firewall:** Security Groups
- **Bootstrap script:** EC2 User Data

### 3. EC2 User Data (Bootstrap Script)
- Script that runs **once** at **first launch** only
- Used to automate boot tasks: install updates, software, download files
- Runs as **root user** (sudo privileges)
- More commands = longer boot time

## Exam Tips
- User Data runs only once at first boot, with root privileges
- EC2 = IaaS (you manage the OS and applications)
