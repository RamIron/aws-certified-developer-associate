# 5.4 - EC2 Instance Types Basics

## Key Concepts

### 1. Instance Naming Convention

Example: `m5.2xlarge`

- **m** = instance class (general purpose)
- **5** = generation (hardware iteration)
- **2xlarge** = size (more size = more CPU + RAM)

### 2. Instance Type Categories

| Category          | Optimized For                               | Use Cases                                               | Name Prefix |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| General Purpose   | Balanced compute/memory/network             | Web servers, code repos                                 | t, m        |
| Compute Optimized | High-performance CPU                        | Batch processing, HPC, ML, gaming servers               | C           |
| Memory Optimized  | Large datasets in RAM                       | In-memory DBs, caches, BI, real-time big data           | R, X1, z1   |
| Storage Optimized | High sequential read/write to local storage | OLTP, NoSQL, data warehousing, distributed file systems | I, D, H1    |

### 3. Free Tier

- t2.micro: 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM (free tier eligible)
- If t2.micro not available in your region, t3.micro is free tier

## Mnemonic: Instance Class Letters

**Compute Optimized (C):**

- **C** = Compute — already obvious, CPU go brrrr

**Memory Optimized (R, X1, z1):**

- **R** = RAM — easy
- **X** = think "eXtra large RAM" — like XL clothing sizes, these instances have eXtra memory
- **z** = "zillion bytes of RAM" — the most extreme memory instances

**Storage Optimized (I, D, H1):**

- **I** = I/O — input/output, reading and writing fast
- **D** = Disk — dense storage, big hard drives
- **H** = HDD — spinning hard disk dense storage

**General Purpose (t, m):**

- **t** = tiny — the small, cheap, general ones (t2.micro = free tier)
- **m** = medium — balanced, middle-of-the-road for everything

```
C  = Compute          (CPU go brrrr)
R  = RAM              (memory)
X  = eXtra large RAM  (XL t-shirt for your memory)
z  = Zillion bytes    (even more RAM)
I  = I/O              (read/write speed)
D  = Disk             (dense storage)
H  = HDD              (hard drives)
t  = Tiny             (free tier buddy)
m  = Medium           (jack of all trades)
```

## Exam Tips

- Know the 4 categories and what they're optimized for
- Don't need to memorize specific instance names
- C = Compute, R = RAM (memory), I/D/H = storage
- General purpose (t, m) = balanced workloads
