# 5.14 - EC2 Instance Purchasing Options

## Key Concepts

### 1. Purchasing Options Overview

| Option                  | Discount  | Commitment        | Best For                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| On-Demand               | None      | None              | Short-term, unpredictable workloads           |
| Reserved Instances      | ~72%      | 1 or 3 years      | Steady-state (e.g., databases)                |
| Convertible Reserved    | ~66%      | 1 or 3 years      | Long workloads with flexible instance type    |
| Savings Plans           | ~70%      | 1 or 3 years      | Commit to $/hour, flexible size & OS          |
| Spot Instances          | ~90%      | None (can lose)   | Resilient workloads (batch, data analysis)    |
| Dedicated Hosts         | Expensive | On-demand or 1-3y | Licensing (BYOL), compliance                  |
| Dedicated Instances     | —         | —                 | Hardware not shared with other accounts       |
| Capacity Reservations   | None      | None              | Reserve capacity in specific AZ               |

### 2. On-Demand
- Pay per second (Linux/Windows) or per hour (other OS)
- Highest cost, no commitment
- Good for short-term, uninterrupted, unpredictable workloads

### 3. Reserved Instances
- Reserve instance type, region, tenancy, OS
- 1 or 3 years (3 years = more discount)
- Payment: no upfront, partial upfront, all upfront (more upfront = more discount)
- Scope: regional or zonal (zonal reserves capacity in specific AZ)
- Can buy/sell in the Reserved Instance Marketplace
- **Convertible:** can change instance type, family, OS, scope, tenancy (less discount ~66%)

### 4. Savings Plans
- Commit to a $/hour spend for 1 or 3 years
- Locked to instance **family + region** (e.g., M5 in us-east-1)
- Flexible across: instance size, OS, tenancy
- Usage beyond plan billed at on-demand price

### 5. Spot Instances
- Up to 90% discount — cheapest option
- Can lose instance at any time (if spot price exceeds your max price)
- Good for: batch jobs, data analysis, image processing, distributed workloads
- **NOT for: critical jobs or databases**

### 6. Dedicated Hosts
- Book an entire physical server
- Use case: BYOL (bring your own license), compliance requirements
- Per-socket, per-core, per-VM licensing models
- Most expensive option

### 7. Dedicated Instances vs Dedicated Hosts
- Dedicated Instance: hardware dedicated to your account, no access to physical server
- Dedicated Host: access to the physical server itself, visibility into lower-level hardware

### 8. Capacity Reservations
- Reserve on-demand capacity in a specific AZ
- No time commitment, no billing discount
- Charged at on-demand rate whether or not you run instances
- Combine with Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for discounts

## Resort Analogy
- **On-Demand:** walk in, pay full price
- **Reserved:** book 1-3 years ahead, big discount
- **Savings Plan:** commit to $300/month, switch room types freely
- **Spot:** last-minute deal on empty rooms, can get kicked out
- **Dedicated Host:** book the entire building
- **Capacity Reservation:** book a room you may not use, still pay full price

## Exam Tips
- Spot = cheapest but unreliable — NEVER for databases or critical workloads
- Reserved/Savings Plans = long-term steady workloads
- Dedicated Host = licensing (BYOL) or compliance
- Capacity Reservation = no discount, just guarantees availability
- Savings Plans lock family+region, flexible on size/OS
- Reserved Instances lock type+region+OS, convertible adds flexibility
