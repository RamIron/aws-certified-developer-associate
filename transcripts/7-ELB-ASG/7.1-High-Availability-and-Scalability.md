# 7.1 - High Availability and Scalability

## Key Concepts

### 1. Vertical Scalability (Scale Up / Scale Down)
- Increase the **size** of an instance (e.g., t2.micro → t2.large)
- Common for **non-distributed systems** like databases (RDS, ElastiCache)
- Has a **hardware limit** — you can't scale up infinitely
- AWS range: t2.nano (0.5 GiB RAM, 1 vCPU) to u-12tb1.metal (12.3 TiB RAM, 450 vCPUs)

### 2. Horizontal Scalability (Scale Out / Scale In)
- Increase the **number** of instances
- **Scale out** = add more instances; **Scale in** = remove instances
- Requires a **distributed system** (not all applications qualify)
- Common for web applications and modern architectures
- Enabled by: **Auto Scaling Groups** and **Load Balancers**

### 3. High Availability
- Run your application in **at least 2 AZs** (data centers)
- Goal: **survive a data center loss**
- Can be **passive** (e.g., RDS Multi-AZ — standby waits for failover)
- Can be **active** (e.g., horizontal scaling across AZs — all instances handle traffic)
- Enabled by: **Auto Scaling Group multi-AZ** + **Load Balancer multi-AZ**

### Call Center Analogy

| Concept       | Analogy                                                    |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Vertical      | Replace junior operator (5 calls/min) with senior (10/min) |
| Horizontal    | Hire 6 operators instead of 1                              |
| High Availability | Split operators across New York + San Francisco        |

## Exam Tips
- **Vertical scaling** = bigger instance, hardware limit, good for databases
- **Horizontal scaling** = more instances (scale out/in), needs distributed systems
- **High availability** = multi-AZ deployment, survive AZ failure
- Scale out = add instances; Scale in = remove instances
- ASG + ELB = the AWS combo for horizontal scaling + high availability
