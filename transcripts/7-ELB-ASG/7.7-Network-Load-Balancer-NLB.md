# 7.7 - Network Load Balancer (NLB)

## Key Concepts

### 1. NLB = Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
- Operates at **Layer 4** — handles **TCP and UDP** traffic (not HTTP)
- **Millions of requests per second** with **ultra-low latency**
- Much higher performance than ALB

### 2. Static IPs
- NLB provides **one static IP per AZ**
- You can assign an **Elastic IP** to each AZ
- Useful when your application needs to be accessible via a **fixed set of IPs**

### 3. Target Groups
NLB target groups can be:

| Target Type     | Notes                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| EC2 Instances   | NLB sends TCP/UDP traffic to them                     |
| IP Addresses    | Must be **private IPs** (own EC2s or on-premises)     |
| ALB             | NLB in front of ALB = static IPs + HTTP routing rules |

### 4. Health Checks
NLB health checks support **three protocols:**
- **TCP**
- **HTTP**
- **HTTPS**

### 5. NLB in Front of ALB

```
[Users] ──► [NLB] ──► [ALB] ──► [Target Groups]
             │           │
             │           └── HTTP routing rules, path-based, etc.
             └── Fixed static IPs / Elastic IPs
```

Combines the best of both: **static IPs** from NLB + **intelligent HTTP routing** from ALB.

## Exam Tips
- See **TCP, UDP** → think **NLB**
- See **extreme performance / millions of requests** → think **NLB**
- See **static IP / Elastic IP / fixed set of IPs** → think **NLB**
- NLB health checks: TCP, HTTP, or HTTPS
- NLB can sit in front of ALB (static IPs + HTTP routing)
- Target groups: EC2 instances, private IPs, or ALB
- **Exam trap:** "fixed static IP for firewall rules / regulators" → NLB (ALB only gives a static DNS name, not a static IP)
