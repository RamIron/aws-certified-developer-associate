# 4.6 - IAM MFA Overview

## Key Concepts

### 1. Password Policy
- Set minimum password length
- Require specific character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Allow/prevent IAM users from changing their own passwords
- Require password expiration (e.g., every 90 days)
- Prevent password reuse
- Helps protect against brute force attacks

### 2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Combines something you **know** (password) + something you **own** (device)
- Even if password is stolen, account is safe without the physical device
- Strongly recommended for root account and all IAM users

### 3. MFA Device Options in AWS
| Device | Type | Key Detail |
|--------|------|------------|
| Virtual MFA (Google Authenticator, Authy) | Software | Supports multiple tokens on one device |
| U2F Security Key (YubiKey) | Physical | One key supports multiple root & IAM users |
| Hardware Key Fob (Gemalto) | Physical | Third-party hardware device |
| GovCloud Key Fob (SurePassID) | Physical | Only for AWS GovCloud (US) |

## Exam Tips
- MFA = password + device (two factors)
- Know all 4 MFA device types
- Virtual MFA and U2F both support multiple users per device
- All hardware MFA providers are third-party (not AWS)
