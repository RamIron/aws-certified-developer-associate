# 4.7 - AWS Access Keys, CLI and SDK

## Key Concepts

### 1. Three Ways to Access AWS
| Method | Protected By | Used For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Management Console | Username + password + MFA | Web interface |
| CLI (Command Line Interface) | Access keys | Terminal commands |
| SDK (Software Development Kit) | Access keys | Application code |

### 2. Access Keys
- Generated through the Management Console
- Consist of: **Access Key ID** (like a username) + **Secret Access Key** (like a password)
- Each user manages their own access keys
- NEVER share access keys — treat them like passwords

### 3. AWS CLI
- Tool to interact with AWS services via command-line shell
- All commands start with `aws` (e.g., `aws s3 cp ...`)
- Direct access to public APIs of AWS services
- Can be used for scripting and automation
- Open-source (GitHub)
- Alternative to the Management Console

### 4. AWS SDK
- Language-specific libraries to access AWS APIs programmatically
- Embedded within your application code (not used in terminal)
- Supports: JavaScript, Python, PHP, .NET, Ruby, Java, Go, Node.js, C++
- Also: Mobile SDK (Android/iOS) and IoT SDK
- Fun fact: the AWS CLI itself is built on the Python SDK (Boto)

## Exam Tips
- CLI and SDK both use **access keys** (not username/password)
- Access Key ID ≈ username, Secret Access Key ≈ password
- AWS CLI is built on Boto (Python SDK)
