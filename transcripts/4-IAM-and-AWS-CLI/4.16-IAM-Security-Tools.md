# 4.16 - IAM Security Tools

## Key Concepts

### 1. IAM Credentials Report (Account-level)
- Lists ALL users in the account and the status of their credentials
- Includes: passwords, access keys, MFA status, key rotation dates
- Used for auditing and compliance

### 2. IAM Access Advisor (User-level)
- Shows service permissions granted to a specific user
- Shows **when** each service was last accessed
- Helps enforce **least privilege** — identify unused permissions and remove them

## Exam Tips
- **Credentials Report** = account-level, all users overview
- **Access Advisor** = user-level, shows last accessed services
- Access Advisor helps implement least privilege principle
