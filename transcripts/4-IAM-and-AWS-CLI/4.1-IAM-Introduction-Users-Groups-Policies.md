# 4.1 - IAM Introduction: Users, Groups, Policies

## Key Concepts

### 1. IAM Overview & Root Account
- IAM = Identity and Access Management (Global service)
- Root account is created by default when you set up your AWS account
- Root account should ONLY be used for initial account setup, then never again
- Never share root account credentials

### 2. Users and Groups
- A **user** represents one person in your organization
- Users can be organized into **groups**
- Groups can ONLY contain users, NOT other groups
- A user can belong to multiple groups (or no group at all)

### 3. IAM Policies (JSON Documents)
- Policies are JSON documents that define **permissions**
- Policies can be attached to users or groups
- When attached to a group, all users in that group inherit the permissions
- Example: allow EC2 describe, ELB describe, CloudWatch access

### 4. Least Privilege Principle
- Don't give more permissions than a user needs
- Only grant access to what is required for the job

## Exam Tips
- IAM is a **global** service (no region selection)
- Groups cannot contain other groups
- A user can belong to **zero or multiple** groups
- Always apply least privilege principle
