# 4.14 - IAM Roles for AWS Services

## Key Concepts

### 1. IAM Roles
- Like users, but intended for **AWS services** (not people)
- Assign permissions to AWS services so they can perform actions on your behalf
- A service assumes a role and gets temporary credentials with the role's permissions

### 2. How It Works
- You create an IAM Role with specific permissions
- You attach the role to an AWS service (e.g., EC2 instance)
- The service uses the role's permissions to make API calls

### 3. Common Roles
- **EC2 Instance Roles** — most common, allows EC2 to call other AWS services
- **Lambda Function Roles** — allows Lambda to access AWS resources
- **CloudFormation Roles** — allows CloudFormation to create/manage resources

## Exam Tips
- Roles are for **services**, not people
- Never put access keys on an EC2 instance — use IAM Roles instead
- Roles provide temporary credentials (more secure than long-lived access keys)
