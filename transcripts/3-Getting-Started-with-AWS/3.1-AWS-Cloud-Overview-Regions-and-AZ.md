# 3.1 - AWS Cloud Overview - Regions & AZ

## Key Concepts

### AWS History
- 2002: Launched internally at Amazon
- 2004: First public offering (SQS)
- 2006: Relaunched with SQS, S3, EC2
- Today: $90B+ revenue, ~31% market share (Q1 2024), 1M+ active users

### AWS Regions
- A region is a **cluster of data centers** (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-3`)
- Most AWS services are **region-scoped** (using a service in one region is independent from another)
- **How to choose a region:**
  1. **Compliance** - Data governance/legal requirements (e.g., data must stay in France)
  2. **Latency** - Deploy close to your users
  3. **Service availability** - Not all regions have all services
  4. **Pricing** - Varies by region

### Availability Zones (AZs)
- Each region has **3 to 6 AZs** (usually 3)
- Example: `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney) has `ap-southeast-2a`, `2b`, `2c`
- Each AZ = **one or more discrete data centers** with redundant power, networking, connectivity
- AZs are **isolated from each other** to prevent disaster cascading
- Connected with **high bandwidth, ultra-low latency** networking

### Points of Presence (Edge Locations)
- 400+ points of presence in 90+ cities across 40+ countries
- Used for **content delivery with lowest latency** (CloudFront)

### Global vs Region-Scoped Services
- **Global services:** IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, WAF
- **Region-scoped services:** EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, Lambda, Rekognition
- Check the **AWS Regional Services** table to verify availability
