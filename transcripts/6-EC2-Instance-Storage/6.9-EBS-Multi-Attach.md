# 6.9 - EBS Multi-Attach

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is Multi-Attach?
- Allows attaching the **same EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances simultaneously**
- Only available for **io1 and io2** volume families (Provisioned IOPS SSD)
- All attached instances have **full read and write permissions** to the volume

### 2. Constraints
- All instances must be in the **same Availability Zone**
- Maximum **16 EC2 instances** can attach the same volume at once
- Requires a **cluster-aware file system** (not XFS or EXT4)

### 3. Use Cases
- Higher application availability in **clustered Linux applications** (e.g., Teradata)
- Applications that must manage **concurrent write operations**

## Exam Tips
- Multi-Attach = **io1 or io2 only** (not gp2, gp3, st1, sc1)
- Max **16 instances** per volume
- Same AZ only — cannot span AZs
- Requires cluster-aware file system
