# 6.5 - AMI Overview

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is an AMI?
- AMI = Amazon Machine Image
- A **customization** of an EC2 instance
- Includes: OS, software, configuration, monitoring tools
- Benefit: **faster boot/config time** — software is pre-packaged

### 2. Types of AMIs
| Type              | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Public AMI        | Provided by AWS (e.g., Amazon Linux 2)                   |
| Custom AMI        | Created and maintained by you                            |
| Marketplace AMI   | Made (and often sold) by third-party vendors on AWS      |

### 3. AMI Process (How to Create One)
1. Launch an EC2 instance and customize it
2. **Stop the instance** (for data integrity)
3. Build the AMI → creates EBS snapshots behind the scenes
4. Launch new instances from the custom AMI

### 4. AMIs are Region-Specific
- Built for a specific region
- Can be copied across regions to use globally

## Exam Tips
- AMIs create EBS snapshots behind the scenes when built
- Stop the instance before creating an AMI (data integrity)
- AMIs are region-locked but can be copied across regions
- Custom AMI = faster boot because software is pre-packaged
