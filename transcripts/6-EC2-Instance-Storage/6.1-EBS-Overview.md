# 6.1 - EBS Overview

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is EBS?
- **EBS** = Elastic Block Store
- A **network drive** (not physical) you attach to EC2 instances
- Persists data even after the instance is terminated
- Think of it as a **network USB stick**

### 2. EBS Characteristics
- **Network drive:** communicates over the network → slight latency possible
- **Locked to an AZ:** an EBS volume in us-east-1a cannot be attached to an instance in us-east-1b
- **Can be detached and reattached** to another instance quickly (great for failovers)
- **Can be left unattached** — not required to be attached to an instance
- **Provisioned capacity:** you define GB + IOPS (I/O operations per second) in advance, billed for what you provision

### 3. Attachment Rules
- One EBS volume → one instance at a time (at base level)
- One instance → multiple EBS volumes (like two USB sticks in one machine)

### 4. Delete on Termination Attribute
- Controls what happens to EBS volumes when an EC2 instance is terminated
- **Root volume:** delete on termination = ON by default
- **Additional volumes:** delete on termination = OFF by default
- Can be changed at launch time via the console

## Exam Tips
- EBS is a network drive, not physical → latency is possible
- EBS is AZ-locked — to move across AZs, take a snapshot first
- Delete on termination: root = deleted by default, extra volumes = kept by default
- To preserve root volume on termination → disable delete on termination
