# 6.3 - EBS Snapshots

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is an EBS Snapshot?
- A backup of an EBS volume at a point in time
- Not necessary to detach the volume first, but recommended
- Can be copied across AZs or Regions
- Main use case: transfer an EBS volume from one AZ to another

### 2. EBS Snapshot Features

| Feature                  | What it does                                     | Key Detail                               |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Snapshot Archive         | Move snapshot to cheaper "archive tier"          | 75% cheaper, but 24-72h restore time     |
| Recycle Bin              | Recover accidentally deleted snapshots           | Retention: 1 day to 1 year               |
| Fast Snapshot Restore    | Full initialization → no latency on first use    | Useful for large snapshots, costs more   |

## Exam Tips
- Snapshots = the way to move EBS volumes across AZs or Regions
- Archive tier = cheap but slow to restore (24-72h)
- Recycle Bin protects against accidental deletion
- Fast Snapshot Restore = no latency but expensive
