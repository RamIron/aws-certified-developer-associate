# 6.7 - EC2 Instance Store

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is EC2 Instance Store?
- A **physical hard drive** attached directly to the hardware server hosting your EC2 instance
- Higher I/O performance than EBS (network drive)
- Trade-off: **ephemeral storage** — data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated

### 2. When to Use
| Use Case         | Instance Store | EBS           |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Buffer / Cache   | ✅ Great       | ❌ Overkill   |
| Scratch / Temp   | ✅ Great       | ❌ Overkill   |
| Long-term data   | ❌ Data lost   | ✅ Persists   |
| High IOPS needs  | ✅ Millions    | ✅ Thousands  |

### 3. Performance vs EBS
- Instance Store (I3 instances): up to 3.3M read IOPS, 1.4M write IOPS
- EBS gp2: up to 32,000 IOPS
- Conclusion: Instance Store is orders of magnitude faster

### 4. Risks
- If the underlying hardware fails → data is lost
- Backup and replication are YOUR responsibility

## Exam Tips
- "Very high performance hardware-attached storage" → **EC2 Instance Store**
- **Ephemeral** = data lost on stop/terminate
- NOT for durable long-term storage — use EBS for that
- Good for: buffer, cache, scratch data, temporary content
