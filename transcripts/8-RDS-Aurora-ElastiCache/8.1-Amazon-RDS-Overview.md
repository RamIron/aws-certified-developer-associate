# 8.1 - Amazon RDS Overview

## Key Concepts

### 1. What is RDS?
- **Relational Database Service** — managed database service for SQL databases
- AWS handles: provisioning, OS patching, backups, monitoring, scaling
- You **cannot SSH** into RDS instances (it's a managed service)
- Storage is backed by **EBS**

### 2. Supported Database Engines
| Engine |
|--------|
| PostgreSQL |
| MySQL |
| MariaDB |
| Oracle |
| Microsoft SQL Server |
| IBM DB2 |
| Aurora (AWS proprietary) |

### 3. Why RDS Over DB on EC2?
| RDS Managed Benefits | Self-managed on EC2 |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Automated provisioning | Manual setup |
| OS patching | Manual patching |
| Continuous backups + Point in Time Restore | Manual backup scripts |
| Monitoring dashboards | Set up your own |
| Read replicas (horizontal scaling) | Configure yourself |
| Multi-AZ (disaster recovery) | Build your own failover |
| Maintenance windows for upgrades | Manual upgrades |
| Vertical & horizontal scaling | Manual scaling |
| **No SSH access** | Full SSH access |

### 4. RDS Storage Auto Scaling
- RDS can **automatically increase storage** when running out of space
- No downtime — no need to take down the database
- You set a **Maximum Storage Threshold** (cap for growth)

**Auto scaling triggers when ALL conditions are met:**
1. Free storage is **less than 10%** of allocated storage
2. Low-storage condition lasts **more than 5 minutes**
3. **6 hours** have passed since last modification

- Supports **all RDS database engines**
- Useful for applications with **unpredictable workloads**

## Exam Tips
- RDS = managed SQL database service — you can't SSH into it
- Know the 7 engines: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, IBM DB2, Aurora
- RDS Storage Auto Scaling: triggers at <10% free, after 5 min, with 6-hour cooldown
- Set a **Maximum Storage Threshold** to cap auto scaling
- RDS storage is backed by EBS
- Point in Time Restore = restore to any specific timestamp
